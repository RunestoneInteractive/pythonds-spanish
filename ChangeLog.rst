---------------

* **Numbered Sections** -- By default when you create a new course
based on this book you will get numbered sections.  If you are rebuilding
an existing course and would like to have numbered sections send me an email.  I'll
need to manually update your index.rst file.

* Typos fixed

-------------

* Bug fixes and typos
* Various typos and clarifications to the text
* start this document for the new Admin interface
* There will probably not be many more changes to this book.  I'm working on a more pythonic version 3.
